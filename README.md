# Slow-Motion Perception as a Base Parameter for Locomotion Mechanical Systems

## Overview
This project explores the concept of using **slow-motion perception** as a base parameter to control locomotion in mechanical systems. Inspired by the human cognitive response during emergencies, the system dynamically adjusts operational speed to improve performance, extend component life, and reduce false emergency activations.

## Objectives
- Investigate the feasibility of translating slow-motion perception into mechanical control.
- Simulate a motorized system with adjustable speed control under both **normal** and **emergency** modes.
- Evaluate system performance using:
  - Time to complete motion
  - Energy consumption
  - Component stress levels

## Files Included
- `simulation.py`: Main Python script to simulate and visualize performance under different modes.
- `results.csv`: (Optional) To store or extend experimental data.
- `LICENSE`: MIT License information.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists Python libraries required for the simulation.
- `.gitignore`: Specifies which files/folders Git should ignore.
- `README.md`: Project overview and setup guide.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository:**
